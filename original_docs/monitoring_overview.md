## Navigation bar

Jobs that have been submitted with Tower can be monitored wherever you have an internet connection. 

The **navigation bar** contains all previous jobs executions. Each new or resumed job will be given a random name e.g: `grave_williams`.

In the left bar:

  - **Blue** are running.
  - **Green** are successfully executed.
  - **Yellow** are successfully executed where some tasks failed.
  - **Red** are jobs where at least one task fully failed.
  - **Grey** are jobs that where forced to stop during execution.

  Selecting a run on the left panel will display the job execution details.

## Search

The search box enables searching for runs and pipelines by name.
