Once shared, the pipeline execution is visible in the user's navigation panel with the launchers name shown.

It is important to ensure your collaborators have permissions to your compute resources to make the most of this feature. For example, information in a cloud bucket such as task logs will only be visible if the collaborator also has access to that bucket.
