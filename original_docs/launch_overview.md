See the [**Compute Environment**](/docs/compute-envs) documentation to learn how to create an environment.

{{% /warning %}}

Tower currently supports launching into **AWS**, **Google**, **Slurm** and **LSF** compute environments.

In the following example we will launch the nf-core RNASeq pipeline using a Google Cloud compute environment we have previously set up.

To launch a pipeline:

**1.** Select the **Launch** button in the navigation bar.

{{% pretty_screenshot img="/uploads/2020/10/launch_button.png" %}}

<br>

The **Launch Pipeline** dialog will appear.

**2.** Select the drop down menu to choose a [**Compute Environment**](/docs/compute-envs/overview).  

*The users primary compute environment is selected by default.*

<br>

**3.** Enter the repository of the **Pipeline to launch**.  
*For example https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq.git*.

**3.** A **Revision number** can be used select different versions of pipeline.  
*The Git default branch (main/master) or `manifest.defaultBranch` in the Nextflow configuration will be used by default.*

**4.** The **Work directory** specifies the location of the Nextflow work directory.  
*The location associated with the compute environment will be selected by default.*

**5.** Enter the name(s) of each of the Nextflow **Config profiles** followed by the `Enter` key.  
*See the Nextflow [Config profiles](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html?highlight=profiles#config-profiles) documentation for more details.*

**6.** Enter any **Pipeline parameters** in YAML or JSON format.
*YAML example:*

{{< highlight yaml >}}
    reads: 's3://nf-bucket/exome-data/ERR013140_{1,2}.fastq.bz2'  
    paired_end: true
{{< /highlight >}}

<br>

**7.** Select *Launch* to begin the pipeline execution.

{{% tip %}}
Nextflow pipelines are simply Git repositories and the location can be any public or private Git-hosting platform. See [**Git Integration**](/docs/git/git-overview) in the Tower docs and [**Pipeline Sharing**](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/sharing.html) in the Nextflow docs for more details.

{{% warning %}}
The credentials associated with the compute environment must be able to access the work directory.

{{% tip %}}
In the configuration, the full path to a bucket must be specified with single-quotes around strings no quotes around booleans or numbers.
