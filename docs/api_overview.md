Tower is API centric, it exposes a public API with all necessary calls to manage and monitor Nextflow workflows programmatically. 
This allows organizations to extend their existing solutions by leveraging the Tower API.


## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from `https://api.tower.nf`. All data is sent and received as [JSON](https://www.json.org/) encoded objects.

All timestamps use the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) date-time standard format:

{{< tip >}}
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
{{< /tip >}}


## Authentication

Tower API requires an authentication token to be specified in each API request using the 
[Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication) HTTP header.

Your personal authorization token can be found in your settings, at the top-right corner of the page under the 
[Your tokens](https://tower.nf/tokens) section.

{{% pretty_screenshot img="/uploads/2020/11/your_tokens.png" %}}

To create a new access token, just provide a name for the token. This will help to identify it later.

{{% pretty_screenshot img="/uploads/2020/11/token_form.png" %}}

Once created, the token can only be seen once, when it is initially created. It is important you keep this token at a safe place.

{{% pretty_screenshot img="/uploads/2020/11/personal_access_token.png" %}}

Once created, use the token to authenticate via cURL, Postman, or within your code against the Nextflow API to perform the necessary calls for completing your tasks. 
Please remember that, as any other Bearer token, this token must be included in every API call.


### Example call using the cURL command

{{< highlight bash >}}
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ...YTk0" https://tower.nf/api/workflow
{{< /highlight >}}


{{% note "Use your token in every API call"%}}
Please remember that, as any other Bearer token, this token must be included in every API call. You can find at the 
following link more details about the [Bearer token authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication).

## Parameters

Some API `GET` methods will accept standard `query` parameters, which are defined in the documentation; `querystring` optional 
parameters such as page size, number (when available) and file name; and body parameters, mostly used for `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests.

Additionally, several head parameters are accepted such as `Authorization` for bearer access token or `Accept-Version` to indicate the desired API version to use (default to version 1.0.)

{{< highlight bash >}}
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer QH..E5M=" 
     -H "Accept-Version:1.0"
     -X POST https://tower.nf/api/domain/{item_id}?queryString={value}
     -d { params: { "key":"value" } }
{{< /highlight >}}

## Client errors

There exists two typical standard errors, or non `200` or `204` status responses, to expect from the API.

### Bad request 

The request payload is not properly defined or the query parameters are invalid.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
    "message": "Oops... Unable to process request - Error ID: 54apnFENQxbvCr23JaIjLb"
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Forbidden 

Your access token is invalid or expired. This response may also imply that the entry point you are trying to access is not available; 
in such a case, it is recommended you check your request syntax.

{{< highlight bash >}}
Status: 403 Forbidden
{{< /highlight >}}

## HTTP verbs

The following table describes the standard and API Rest verbs used.

| Verb | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `HEAD` | Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info |
| `GET` | Used for retrieving resources |
| `POST` | Used for creating resources |
| `PUT` | Used for updating resources |
| `DELETE` | Used for deleting resources |

## Rate limiting

For all API requests, there is a threshold of 20 calls per second (72000 calls per hour) and access key.
