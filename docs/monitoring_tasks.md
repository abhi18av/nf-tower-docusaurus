## Task table

The **Tasks** section shows all the tasks from an execution.

You can use the `Search` bar to filter tasks by process name, tag, hash, status, etc. 

Selecting a status in **status** section filters the task table.  E.g. clicking in the _CACHED_ card in the **status** column.

Selecting a `process` in the **Processes** section above will filter all tasks for that specific process.

Selecting a task in the task table provides specific information about the task in the **Task details** dialog.

The task details dialog has the task information tab and the task **Execution log** tab.

### Execution log

The **Execution log** provides a realtime log of the individual task of a Nextflow execution. 

This can be very helpful for troubleshooting. It is possible to download the log files including `stdout` and `stderr` from your compute environment.

## Resource metrics

This section displays plots with CPU, memory, task duration and I/O usage, grouped by process.

These metrics can be used to profile an execution to ensure that the correct amount or resources are being requested for each process.
